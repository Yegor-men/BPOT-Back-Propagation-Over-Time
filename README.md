# BPOT-Back-Propagation-Over-Time
BPTT (Back Propagation Through Time) is widely and rightfully considered to be biologically implausible. It imples not only storing raw inputs over an arbitrary amount of time, it also implies some central control that can pause learning and all this in one timestep. So what if instead, back propagation was done across multiple timesteps?
